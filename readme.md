## `init-exporter`

Utility for exporting services described by Procfile to init system.
Supported init systems: upstart and systemd

#### Installation

To build the init-exporter from scratch, make sure you have a working Go 1.5+ workspace ([instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)), then:

```bash
go get -d github.com/funbox/init-exporter
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/funbox/init-exporter
make all
sudo make install
```

#### Configuration

The export process can be configured through the config `/etc/init-exporter.conf`
The config is not installed by default. If this config is absent, the default values are the following:

```
# Default configuration for init-exporter

[main]

  # Default run user
  run-user: service

  # Default run group
  run-group: service

  # Prefix used for exported units and helpers
  prefix: fb-

[paths]

  # Working dir
  working-dir: /tmp

  # Path to directory with helpers
  helper-dir: /var/local/init-exporter/helpers

  # Path to directory with systemd configs
  systemd-dir: /etc/systemd/system

  # Path to directory with upstart configs
  upstart-dir: /etc/init

[log]

  # Enable or disable logging here
  enabled: true

  # Log file directory
  dir: /var/log/init-exporter

  # Path to log file
  file: {log:dir}/init-exporter.log

  # Default log file permissions
  perms: 0644

  # Minimal log level (debug/info/warn/error/crit)
  level: info
```

To give a certain user (i.e. `deployuser`) the ability to use this script, you can place the following lines into `sudoers` file:

    # Commands required for manipulating jobs
    Cmnd_Alias UPSTART = /sbin/start, /sbin/stop, /sbin/restart
    Cmnd_Alias UPEXPORT = /usr/local/bin/init-export

    ...

    # Add gem's binary path to this
    Defaults    secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

    ...

    # Allow deploy user to manipulate jobs
    deployuser        ALL=(deployuser) NOPASSWD: ALL, (root) NOPASSWD: UPSTART, UPEXPORT


#### Usage

Gem is able to process two versions of Procfiles, format of the Procfile is
defined in the `version` key. If the key is not present or is not equal to `2`
file will be parsed as Procfile v.1.

##### Procfile v.1

After upstart-exporter is installed and configured, you may export background jobs
from an arbitrary Procfile-like file of the following format:

```yaml
    cmdlabel1: cmd1
    cmdlabel2: cmd2
```

i.e. a file `./myprocfile` containing:

```yaml
    my_tail_cmd: /usr/bin/tail -F /var/log/messages
    my_another_tail_cmd: /usr/bin/tail -F /var/log/messages
```

For security purposes, command labels are allowed to contain only letters, digits, and underscores.

##### Procfile v.2

Another format of Procfile scripts is YAML config. A configuration script may
look like this:

```yaml
    version: 2
    start_on_runlevel: 3
    stop_on_runlevel: 3
    env:
      RAILS_ENV: production
      TEST: true
    working_directory: /srv/projects/my_website/current
    commands:
      my_tail_cmd:
        command: /usr/bin/tail -F /var/log/messages
        respawn:
          count: 5
          interval: 10
        env:
          RAILS_ENV: staging # if needs to be redefined or extended
        working_directory: '/var/...' # if needs to be redefined
      my_another_tail_cmd:
        command: /usr/bin/tail -F /var/log/messages
        kill_timeout: 60
        respawn: false # by default respawn option is enabled
      my_one_another_tail_cmd:
        command: /usr/bin/tail -F /var/log/messages
        log: /var/log/messages_copy
      my_multi_tail_cmd:
        command: /usr/bin/tail -F /var/log/messages
        count: 2
```

`start_on_runlevel` and `stop_on_runlevel` are two global options that can't be
redefined per-command.

`working_directory` will generate the following line:

    cd 'your/working/directory' && your_command

`env` params can be redefined and extended in per-command options. Note that
you can't remove a globally defined `env` variable.
For Procfile example given earlier the generated command will look like:

    env RAILS_ENV=staging TEST=true your_command

`log` option lets you override the default log location (`/var/log/fb-my_website/my_one_another_tail_cmd.log`).

`kill_timeout` option lets you override the default process kill timeout of 30 seconds.

`respawn` option controls how often the job can fail. If the job restarts more
often than `count` times in `interval`, it won't be restarted anymore.

Options `working_directory`, `env`, `log`, `respawn` can be
defined both as global and as per-command options.

#### Exporting

To export a Procfile you should run

    sudo upstart-export -p ./myprocfile -f format myapp

where `myapp` is the application name.
This name only affects the names of generated files.
For security purposes, app name is also allowed to contain only letters, digits and underscores.
where format is `(upstart | systemd)`

Assuming that default options are used, the following files and folders will be generated (in case of upstart format):

in `/etc/init/`:

    fb-myapp-my_another_tail_cmd.conf
    fb-myapp-my_tail_cmd.conf
    fb-myapp.conf

in `/var/local/init-exporter/helpers`:

    fb-myapp-my_another_tail_cmd.sh
    fb-myapp-my_tail_cmd.sh

Prefix `fb-` (which can be customised through config) is added to avoid collisions with other jobs.
After this `my_tail_cmd`, for example, will be able to be started as an Upstart job:

    sudo start fb-myapp-my_tail_cmd

    ..

    sudo stop fb-myapp-my_tail_cmd

Its stdout/stderr will be redirected to `/var/log/fb-myapp/my_tail_cmd.log`.

To start/stop all application commands at once, you can run:

    sudo start fb-myapp
    ...
    sudo stop fb-myapp

To remove upstart scripts and helpers for a particular application you can run

    sudo init-export -u -f upstart myapp

The logs are not cleared in this case. Also, all old application scripts are cleared before each export.
